Hi I'm Jack, or 0xtatsu. I decided to make this blog to share what I learn about programming, technology, or anything else that seems interesting. 

I've been working as a sofware developer for a while now, and I want to use that experience to pursue the topics I'm most passionate about. 

I love building beautiful and performant software, and I aim to do that in the finance space. 

If you have any enquiries or just want to say hi, feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:tatsu@protonmail.com).

I hope that you enjoy!
